# AI_JOB_MARKET_REPORT
This project explores trends in AI job postings using Power BI, based on various factors like job title, experience level, company size, industry, and location. Key insights include salary progression, hiring demand across experience levels, company types, and seasonal trends.

# ðŸ”§ What I Did
1.SQL Data Connection

Connected Power BI directly to a SQL database.

Imported and refreshed data regularly from the source.

2.Data Cleaning

Used Power Query to clean and transform the data (remove blanks, fix data types, filter records).

4.DAX Measures

Wrote DAX formulas for:

Average salary

Job counts by category

Salary by experience and company size

Time-based trends

5.Interactive Dashboards

Built visual reports with bar charts, line graphs, slicers, and cards.

Pages include job role trends, salary vs experience, company insights, and time analysis.
